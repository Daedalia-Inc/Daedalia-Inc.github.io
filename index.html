    <h1>Privacy Policy for Soulflame</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 27, 2025</p>

    <p>The Soulflame app is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Soulflame app, an AI-powered chatbot application developed by Daedalia, Inc ("we," "us," or "our").</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect and process the following data in order to operate, improve, and personalize the Soulflame experience:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication Data:</strong> When you sign in using Apple Sign-In or Google Sign-In, we collect unique identifiers (such as your Apple or Google user ID). With your permission, we may store your email or profile photo with explicitly authorization.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat Content:</strong> We store the content of your conversations with the Soulflame chatbot. This includes messages you send and receive while using the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Metadata:</strong> We may collect technical data about how you interact with the app, such as time of interaction, message frequency, and basic device information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide core app functionality, including chat interactions and login authentication</li>
        <li>To improve app performance and user experience through debugging and feature enhancement</li>
        <li>To review user interactions in order to better understand usage patterns and service quality</li>
        <li>To train, fine-tune, or evaluate current and future AI models, including language and behavior models, using anonymized or pseudonymized data where applicable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may analyze both real-time and historical chat data for research, development, and model optimization. Data used for training will follow internal data protection policies and industry standards for de-identification.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Access and Review</h2>
    <p>Authorized personnel and automated systems may review user content for safety, quality control, and training purposes. Reviews are conducted under strict confidentiality, and any insights used for AI model improvement are handled using secure and auditable processes.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> If you delete your account through the app, all associated data — including all user identifiers — will be <strong>permanently erased</strong> from our systems and cannot be restored.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymization:</strong> We may retain anonymized or aggregated data after account deletion for legitimate business purposes, such as service improvement, AI model research, and performance analysis. These datasets contain no personal identifiers and cannot be linked back to you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect your data from unauthorized access, misuse, or loss. This includes encryption, access control, and secure cloud infrastructure.</p>
